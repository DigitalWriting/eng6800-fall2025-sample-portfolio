# Welcome to My Sample Portfolio

This site demonstrates some basic **Markdown** and HTML features you can use in your GitHub Pages site.

---

## Headings and Text
You can write regular text, or emphasize things with *italics* and **bold**.  
You can also create blockquotes:

> "Digital writing is about *making* as much as it is about writing."  

---

## Lists
- Unordered list item
- Another item
  - Nested sub-item

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
3. Third item

---

## Code Blocks
Inline code looks like this: `print("Hello, world!")`.

Fenced code blocks work too:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
